# Surface View Application
This Android Application creates a graph of x axis and y axis with randomized data of y = mx +b and gives an option to change the slope and y intercept of all the lines dynamically.

Description:-The main page of the Application gives you an option to Draw Graph which when clicked generates 10 random lines in the graph, apart from that there are two seekers slope, y intercept when changed both will implement this changes in canvas and you can visualize the change dynamically.

Idea:- I researched more about the assignment description and designed the application for showing as much as visualization possible and learning to implement things at basic level

Future update: Include a option to select each line and change slope and y intercept of only that line. Also include more shapes like circle and rectangle etc. Also improve the UI  

Note :-No external libraries used, everything is done with the help of canvas.

Total commits :- 13 commits

Tasks done each day(1 commit everyday):-

Day 1:- Created a Repository for the Application

Day 2:- Added the sample start code which the professor gave

Day 3:- Tried making changes in layout and adding seeker

Day 4:- Implemented drawing lines on canvas.

Day 5:- Made some more changes on lines and figuring out how to make it graph.

Day 6:-  Made the x axis and y axis

Day 7:- Arrow at line end other visualization changes

Day 8:- Implemented grid and other requirements

Day 9:-  Tried to implement slope and y intercept

Day 10:- On touch coordinates return on click and other updates

Day 11:- Numbering on the axis for better visualization

Day 12:- Fixed all errors and making it compatible with smaller screens and other devices

Day 13:- Implemented the slope and y intercept to change dynamically when the seeker both changed
